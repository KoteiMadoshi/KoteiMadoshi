# üëã Hi, I'm Antonio Catanzaro,
**_a Computer Science student from "Universit√† degli studi di Bari Aldo Moro", based in Bari, Italy ![Italy Flag](assets/images/italy_flag.png)._** 

## üìã Bio
The first evidence of my existence dates back to **_1st february of 1999_**, in a hospital in Bari. I grew up in **_Molfetta_**, a small city nearby, attending various schools until, at the age of 13, I enrolled in an **_[Technical Institute](https://www.ferrarismolfetta.edu.it/)_** thus discovering my vocation towards computer science. With many difficulties due to various adolescent troubles, I graduated with a score of 76/100 and, lost and disoriented, thrown into the hard laws of the job world, I decided to fall back on university üòÑ.

Joking aside, I am now passionately studying this beautiful branch of science that I am so passionate about with two objectives:
- to do a job that I enjoy and that allows me to earn an honest salary;
- enjoy the rest of my free time doing what I like, in an increasingly frenetic world.
 
Come on, I'm a chill guy who wants to live a peaceful life, I don't think I'm asking too much üôÑ.
